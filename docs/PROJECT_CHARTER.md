# Juniper Bible - Project Charter

## 1. Vision & Purpose

### Mission Statement
A content-addressed capsule system that stores original bytes verbatim and produces deterministic behavior transcripts by running reference tools (libSWORD and others) inside a pinned NixOS VM, with self-check plans that power TDD/CI.

### Problem Being Solved
Bible formats and conversion tools are:
- Poorly specified
- Historically quirky
- Full of edge cases people rely on

Re-implementing them by "reading docs" fails. Juniper Bible solves this by measuring what tools actually do, freezing that behavior, and making our code match.

### Target Users/Audience
- Bible tool developers
- Religious text researchers
- Archivists requiring byte-perfect preservation
- Anyone needing deterministic conversion verification

## 2. Core Guarantees (Non-Negotiables)

### Byte Sovereignty (Absolute)
- All inputs are stored **verbatim**
- SHA-256 and BLAKE3 hashes are recorded
- Exporting "back to native" always re-emits the exact original bytes
- No normalization. No cleanup. No guessing.

### Behavioral Authority
- "Correct behavior" is defined by **reference tools**
- Tools run in a pinned NixOS VM
- Output is captured as deterministic **transcripts**
- Transcripts are compared by hash in tests
- Documentation never overrides observed behavior

### Determinism
- Same input + same engine = same hashes
- If it's flaky, it's a bug
- Fix the harness, don't loosen the tests

## 3. Scope

### In-Scope Features
- Content-addressed blob storage (SHA-256 primary, BLAKE3 secondary)
- Capsule pack/unpack (tar.xz and zip formats)
- Manifest generation and JSON schema validation
- Deterministic NixOS VM execution environment
- Format plugins: file, dir, zip, tar, SWORD
- Tool plugins: libSWORD (first reference implementation)
- RoundTrip Plan execution
- SelfCheck Report generation
- CLI commands: ingest, enumerate, run, export, verify, selfcheck, test

### Out-of-Scope (Explicitly)
- Guaranteed byte-identical regeneration from semantic IR for every format
- Naive file conversion
- Canonicalization tools
- Parsers that "fix" data
- Best-effort systems

### Dependencies
- NixOS for deterministic VM
- SWORD library (libsword) for reference behavior
- Go standard library for implementation

## 4. Core Concepts

### Artifact
Immutable record pointing to a content-addressed blob and metadata:
- kind: zip, tar, sword-module, sword-conf, sword-data, osis, usfm, pdf, unknown
- hashes: sha256 + optional blake3
- blob path in capsule

### Capsule
Portable container (tar.xz or zip) holding:
- manifest.json
- blobs/sha256/<2>/<sha256>
- optional blobs/blake3/<2>/<blake3>.json pointer files
- transcripts and derived artifacts stored as blobs

### Engine
Reproducible execution environment:
- NixOS VM, pinned flake.lock hash
- Pinned locale/timezone (TZ=UTC, LC_ALL=C.UTF-8)
- No network
- Fixed mount points /work/in and /work/out

### Transcript
Deterministic JSONL event stream emitted by a tool plugin:
- ENGINE_INFO, MODULE_DISCOVERED, KEY_ENUM
- ENTRY_RENDERED, WARN, ERROR
- Each event references derived payloads by hash

### RoundTrip Plan
Declarative pipeline definition:
- Run tool(s)
- Export identity
- Run tool(s) again
- Compare hashes

### SelfCheck Report
Machine-readable deterministic pass/fail artifact:
- Stored as blobs
- Compared by hash
- Forms the basis of TDD/CI

## 5. Current Status

- Host-side VM runner (mounts /work/in and /work/out)
- Enforce TZ/LC_ALL/LANG, no network

### Phase 3: Plugin System ✓
- Plugin loader + contract enforcement
- Format plugins: file, dir, zip, tar, SWORD enumerator
- Tool plugin: tools.libsword (emits transcript JSONL and content blobs)

### Phase 4: Self-Check Engine ✓
- RoundTripPlan execution
- SelfCheckReport generation
- Default plans: identity-bytes, libsword-behavior-identity

### Phases 5-14: Extended Implementation ✓
- 43 bidirectional format plugins (L0-L3 loss classes)
- IR (Intermediate Representation) system with lossless round-trips
- Cross-format conversion via IR pipeline
- NixOS VM integration for SWORD transcript generation
- 11 sample Bible modules for integration testing
- Plugin IPC calls in selfcheck executor

### Phases 15-19: Advanced Features ✓

  - core/epub: EPUB3 creation/parsing (replaces calibre)
  - core/gobible: GoBible JAR creation (replaces GoBible Creator)

See TODO.txt for detailed phase breakdown.

## 7. Success Criteria

### Per-Phase Goals
| Phase | Criterion |
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | ingest -> export(ID) produces identical hashes |
| 2 | Same tool run twice produces identical transcript hashes |
| 3 | libSWORD output fully captured and replayable |
| 4 | capsule selfcheck produces stable SelfCheckReport |

### Quality Metrics
- Tests compare **hashes**, not text
- Goldens are transcript hashes and selfcheck hashes
- If a hash changes, it must be explained
- No snapshot tests. No "looks right."

### Feature Completeness
A feature is done when:
- Its outputs are blobs with hashes
- Its behavior is captured in a transcript
- There is a self-check plan that verifies it
- CI compares hashes, not text diffs

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| SWORD format changes | Medium | Pin libsword version in Nix flake |
| VM non-determinism | High | Strict environment controls, no timestamps |
| Tool output timestamps | Medium | Normalization plugin step if needed |
| Large corpus performance | Medium | Chunked JSONL, content-addressed bundles |
| Plugin security | Low | Plugins from trusted paths, never auto-execute from capsules |

## 9. Stakeholders

### Owner/Maintainer
- Project lead responsible for architectural decisions

### Contributors
- Developers following TDD workflow
- Must match transcripts, not expectations

### Users
- Bible software developers
- Religious text researchers
- Anyone needing forensic-grade format conversion

## 10. Development Methodology

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
This project follows strict TDD:
1. Write tests FIRST for each feature before implementation
2. Tests compare **hashes**, not text
3. Goldens are transcript hashes and selfcheck hashes
4. Each task follows: [T] Test -> [I] Implement -> [V] Verify pattern

### Implementation Language
**Go (Golang)** - Plugin interfaces for format/tool extensions

### The Rule to Remember
> **If the transcript says it behaves that way, that's how it behaves.**

Everything else is an implementation detail.
