## Overview

Juniper Bible uses forked versions of two dependencies to support specific functionality or bug fixes not yet available in upstream. While forks provide necessary features, they introduce a security maintenance burden as they may miss upstream security updates.

**Security Notice**: All forked dependencies must be regularly synchronized with upstream to incorporate security patches and bug fixes.

## Forked Dependencies

### alecthomas/kong

**Upstream Repository**: https://github.com/alecthomas/kong
**Fork Repository**: https://github.com/FocuswithJustin/kong
**Version**: v1.13.0
**Last Sync Date**: 2026-01-09

#### Why Forked

The kong CLI framework fork includes the following modifications:

1. **Custom Resolver Support**: Enhanced resolver interface for dynamic configuration loading
2. **Environment Variable Handling**: Improved environment variable prefix handling for nested structures
3. **Help Text Formatting**: Customized help text rendering for better UX in Juniper Bible CLI

#### Differences from Upstream

- **Files Modified**:
  - `resolver.go`: Added support for custom configuration sources
  - `context.go`: Enhanced context handling for nested commands
  - `help.go`: Customized help text formatting

- **Behavior Changes**:
  - Supports loading configuration from multiple sources (env, file, defaults)
  - Better integration with structured config types (api.Config, web.Config)
  - Preserves all upstream functionality and tests

#### Keeping in Sync

1. **Monitor upstream releases**: https://github.com/alecthomas/kong/releases
2. **Check for security advisories**: https://github.com/alecthomas/kong/security/advisories
3. **Merge upstream changes monthly**:
   ```bash
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/FocuswithJustin/kong
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/alecthomas/kong.git
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/master
   # Resolve conflicts, ensuring custom changes are preserved
   git push origin master
   ```
4. **Update go.mod version** if fork changes
5. **Run tests** to ensure compatibility: `make test`

#### Upstream Contribution Status

**Status**: Not contributed upstream (waiting for design review)

**Reason**: The custom resolver changes are specific to Juniper Bible's configuration model. Upstream maintainer feedback needed before proposing a pull request.

**Future Plan**:
- Extract generic resolver interface improvements
- Propose upstream PR with broader use case
- If accepted, remove fork and use upstream version

### alecthomas/participle

**Upstream Repository**: https://github.com/alecthomas/participle
**Fork Repository**: https://github.com/FocuswithJustin/participle
**Version**: v2.1.4 (upstream equivalent: v2.1.1+)
**Last Sync Date**: 2026-01-09

#### Why Forked

The participle parser library fork includes the following modifications:

1. **USFM Parser Support**: Custom lexer extensions for USFM marker parsing
2. **Position Tracking**: Enhanced source position tracking for error reporting
3. **Unicode Handling**: Improved UTF-8 byte-order mark (BOM) handling

#### Differences from Upstream

- **Files Modified**:
  - `lexer/text_scanner.go`: Enhanced Unicode BOM handling
  - `lexer/peek.go`: Added custom token lookahead for USFM
  - `parse.go`: Improved error position reporting

- **Behavior Changes**:
  - Handles USFM markers like `\id`, `\c`, `\v` correctly
  - Better error messages with line/column positions
  - UTF-8 BOM detection and stripping
  - Preserves all upstream functionality and tests

#### Keeping in Sync

1. **Monitor upstream releases**: https://github.com/alecthomas/participle/releases
2. **Check for security advisories**: https://github.com/alecthomas/participle/security/advisories
3. **Merge upstream changes monthly**:
   ```bash
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/FocuswithJustin/participle
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/alecthomas/participle.git
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/master
   # Resolve conflicts, ensuring USFM parser changes are preserved
   git push origin master
   ```
4. **Update go.mod version** if fork changes
5. **Run USFM parser tests**: `go test ./plugins/format/usfm/...`

#### Upstream Contribution Status

**Status**: Not contributed upstream (needs generalization)

**Reason**: The USFM-specific lexer extensions are domain-specific. Would need to be generalized into a "custom token extension" API before upstream contribution.

**Future Plan**:
- Design generic custom lexer extension API
- Refactor USFM parser to use generic API
- Propose upstream PR with documentation and tests
- If accepted, remove fork and use upstream version with custom extensions

## Security Update Process

### Monitoring for Security Issues

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**:
   - Enable "Watch" on both upstream repositories
   - Subscribe to security advisories: Settings → Notifications → Security alerts
   - Check advisories regularly: https://github.com/alecthomas/kong/security/advisories
   - Check advisories regularly: https://github.com/alecthomas/participle/security/advisories

2. **Go Vulnerability Database**:
   - Run `govulncheck` regularly (included in CI/CD)
   - Check https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/ for Go ecosystem vulnerabilities
   - Subscribe to golang-announce mailing list

3. **Dependabot Alerts**:
   - Enable Dependabot on the main Juniper Bible repository
   - Review Dependabot PRs promptly (especially security updates)
   - Configure auto-merge for patch-level security updates

### Responding to Security Issues

**Timeline**:
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Merge and update within 24 hours
- **High severity**: Merge and update within 7 days
- **Medium severity**: Merge and update within 30 days
- **Low severity**: Merge during regular monthly sync

**Process**:
1. **Assess Impact**: Determine if the vulnerability affects Juniper Bible's use of the library
2. **Sync Fork**: Merge upstream security fix into fork immediately
3. **Update go.mod**: Bump version in go.mod to use patched fork
4. **Test**: Run full test suite: `make test`
5. **Deploy**: Release patched version of Juniper Bible
6. **Document**: Update this file with sync date and details

### Testing After Updates

After syncing with upstream:

1. **Unit Tests**: `make test`
2. **Integration Tests**: `make test-sqlite-divergence`
3. **Plugin Tests**: Test affected format plugins (USFM, CLI commands)
4. **Manual Testing**:
   - Run `capsule --help` to verify kong CLI works
   - Test USFM ingest: `capsule ingest testdata/examples/sample.usfm`
5. **Performance**: Ensure no performance regressions

## Monitoring Upstream Changes

### Automated Monitoring

**GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/check-upstream-forks.yml`):

```yaml
# Check for upstream updates weekly
name: Check Upstream Forks
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1'  # Every Monday at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check-upstream:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check kong upstream
        run: |
          curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/alecthomas/kong/releases/latest | \
            jq -r '.tag_name'
          # Compare with current fork version

      - name: Check participle upstream
        run: |
          curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/alecthomas/participle/releases/latest | \

## Fork Maintenance Schedule

### Regular Maintenance

**Monthly** (1st Monday of each month):
- Review upstream releases
- Merge non-breaking changes
- Update go.mod versions
- Run full test suite
- Update this document with sync date

**Quarterly** (Every 3 months):
- Major version updates (if any)
- Performance benchmarking
- Review fork necessity (can we remove it?)
- Consider upstream contribution

**Annually**:
- Comprehensive security audit of forks
- Review fork architecture and necessity
- Plan upstream contribution roadmap
- Update fork documentation

### Emergency Maintenance

**Critical Security Issues**:
- Immediate sync within 24 hours
- Emergency release if necessary
- Notify users via security advisory

## Alternatives to Forking

To reduce maintenance burden, consider these alternatives:

1. **Upstream Contribution**:
   - Contribute changes upstream when possible
   - Work with maintainers to merge features
   - Reduces long-term maintenance

2. **Adapter Pattern**:
   - Wrap upstream library with adapter layer
   - Implement custom behavior in adapter
   - Update adapter when upstream changes

3. **Alternative Libraries**:
   - Evaluate alternative CLI frameworks (cobra, urfave/cli)
   - Evaluate alternative parsers (ANTLR, goyacc)
   - Trade-off: migration cost vs. maintenance cost

4. **Feature Flags**:
   - Use feature flags to toggle custom behavior
   - Easier to sync with upstream
   - Can be contributed upstream as opt-in features

## Version Pinning Policy

**Current Policy**: Use exact version pins for forked dependencies

**Rationale**:
- Ensures reproducible builds
- Prevents unexpected behavior changes
- Allows controlled updates with testing

**Update Policy**:
- Patch updates: Auto-merge after tests pass
- Minor updates: Manual review and testing
- Major updates: Comprehensive review and migration plan
