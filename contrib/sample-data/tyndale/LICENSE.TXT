ABOUT:
William Tyndale's 1525 New Testament and 1530 Pentateuch.

 A partial translation from the Hebrew and Greek, never completed. Tyndale translated the entire New Testament, but of the Old Testament he only published the Pentateuch and the book of Jonah.

 The earliest existing edition is from 1525, but manuscripts of that only have a part of Matthew. Of the whole New Testament, the earliest manuscripts available are from 1526. Old Testament books are from later, 1530's for some.
