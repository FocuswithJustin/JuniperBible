ABOUT:

This module has been build from the following source from the Center for Computer Analysis of Texts (CCAT) at the University of Pennsylvania : 
http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/lxxmorph/

The versification differs slightly from what is defined in canon_lxx.h in the Sword sources. 
Some of the noticeable differences are:

- Prayer of Manasseh is found in Odes 12.
- Prayer of Azariah is found at Daniel 3:24.
- No I Enoch
- The book and Ezra and of Nehemiah are part of a second book of Esdras. They are available as Ezra and Nehemiah in this module.
- The book of Proverbs chapter 32 to 36 are available in this module as chapters 25 to 29.
- Some books have less chapter than expected: Esther, Malachi
